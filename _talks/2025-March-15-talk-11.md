I have been attending embo++ since 2022. As the name suggests, it is a conference dedicated to all aspects of embedded systems. In March 2025 embo++, I gave a talk titled “Experiences with Codebases of Three C++ Quantum Libraries.” I focused on these libraries because of my recent interest in quantum computing compilers. In particular, I have been exploring how quantum compilers represent and map quantum circuits, following the typical pipeline: Quantum program → Quantum compiler → Quantum circuit → Quantum hardware. Since it was a lightning talk, I could not give a deep-dive as I really wanted to. I may give a longer talk on this in the future, as I am now better prepared.
