This talk presents an open-source Linux block I/O storage framework called "DeLiBA-K" that leverages FPGA to accelerate block storage operations in data centers. Notably, DeLiBA-K is the first storage research framework to integrate Linux new asynchronous I/O interface, "io_uring", into an FPGA-based framework. Since DeLiBA-K uses an open-source distributed storage called Ceph as a use case, it delivers better speed-ups compared to contemporary Ceph I/O hardware accelerators. These speed-ups have been rigorously tested and validated in an industrial environment with real-world workloads.
