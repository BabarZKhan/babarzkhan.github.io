I grew up in Dubai and spent the first 13 years of my life there, where I also completed my schooling. Learnt also some basic Arab. Although I can read Arabic easily but my Arabic speaking skills are verz basic. So, this year (2025) I had a week off from my day job, during which I visited Dubai. Since I work on distributed systems (storage and networking) and occasionally on related applications such as ultra-low-latency trading, I took the opportunity to explore the DIFC Innovation Hub. It is the largest innovation community in the region and is home to more than 1,240 growth-stage tech firms, established innovation companies, digital labs, venture capital firms, regulators, and educational institutions.
